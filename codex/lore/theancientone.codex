    "Years before Earth's destruction, a lone figure entered the Bossvault. It was a small winged creature, none other than the penguin pirate Dreadwing. Without being detected by the ancient security systems, Dreadwing salvaged a large amount of ancient materials. After leaving, Dreadwing used the ancient materials to build a spacecraft more powerful than any in the known universe.",
	"Once he turned it on, however, the machine began scanning the area and acting puzzled as if it had a mind of its own. It seemed the ancient materials and the mysterious core Dreadwing used for the spacecraft's power source had created a \"living\" machine with its own independent behavior. The spacecraft began firing powerful energy bolts at Dreadwing, but he swiftly dashed through an escape hatch where the machine could not reach him. Having lost sight of its target it left Dreadwing's base and instinctively flew toward the planet where",
	"the Bossvault was. As it passed through the galaxy and over planets, people who believed in legends of ancient beings referred to the strange spacecraft traveling over the planet as The Ancient One. Dreadwing, who had learned his lesson about tampering with such power, decided to build his spacecraft out of more conventional materials. As for The Ancient One, it eventually found its way back to the Bossvault and currently guards it against anyone who dares try to steal the ancients' secrets."
