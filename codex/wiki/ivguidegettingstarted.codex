Should be pretty simple. Now, you place the object on the ground and enter the dimension. ^red;Note that you must be very well prepared^reset;. Also, the dimension takes an unusually long time to load. This is a normal thing because the place is HUGE!!! Once loaded, you should jump down the hole(be careful doing so). SAIL will talk about some sort of anomaly underground. You must enter said",
	"anomaly and take down the mother poptop(who knows why she's there).

Proceed to the next page once you kill the mother poptop.",
	"You then go through the hall above you filled with gleaps and poptops. Once you pass through there, you will have to kill the ancient AI above you. The materials it drops are necessary for crafting ancient gear at the ancient forge. 
How do you get the ancient forge? It is crafted at the architect's table. Hopefully this guide gives you the bare basics. You should be able to understand everything else about the mod. Good luck and have fun."
